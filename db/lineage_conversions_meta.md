# Lineage conversions table meta

This table comes from https://github.com/jodyphelan/tbdb/blob/master/barcode.bed

This is a barcode of all Fst = 1 SNPs generated by this paper - https://doi.org/10.1186/s13073-020-00817-3

All the SNP data has been stripped out and so just the lineages data has been left. 

The SNPs have been identified as belonging to an "MTBC lineage" - i.e. column 1, and at some point the other lineage columns have been joined via a lookup table. We're not sure what this is or where this has come from, but it seems to be right. 

The supplementary material for this paper
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6814786/
contains a table which corresponds to our table (minus the RD numbers; they are referenced below), and also seems to reference the origins of the different systems. Column headers and reference for that table are as follows:


| MTBC lineage (1, 2) | LSP lineage (2) | Spoligotype family (4) |
