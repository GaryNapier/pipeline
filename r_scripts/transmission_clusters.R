# transmission_clusters.R

# Find samples within a SNP distance of a given threshold and cluster together.

# Example:
# Given this matrix:
#    A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H  I J
# A  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0 0
# B 51  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0 0
# C  3  1  0  0  0  0  0  0  0 0
# D 71 84 15  0  0  0  0  0  0 0
# E 44 35 22 65  0  0  0  0  0 0
# F 58 27 69 48  5  0  0  0  0 0
# G 51 48 64 24 50 11  0  0  0 0
# H 56 48 49 59 52 26 62  0  0 0
# I 30  2 54 32 78 22 21 79  0 0
# J 62 32 75 13 48 13 56 97 62 0

# If the threshold distance is 12, there are two clusters of 4 and 3 samples:
# A-C-B-I, E-F-G

# See appendix at the end of this script for examples

# Methods > Phylogenetic analysis

# "Initially, broad putative clusters of cases were constructed for
# application of the Bayesian transmission inference analysis.
# The clusters were constructed using R software to group cases
# with a maximum pairwise SNP distance threshold of 50 SNPs,
# i.e. a case was included in a cluster if there were â‰¤50 SNP
# differences from one or more cases within this cluster. The
# threshold to determine potential transmission links between
# patients has previously typically been fixed between 5 and 12
# SNP differences [6, 15, 26], although recent analysis of within
# patient variation has suggested this estimate may be too low
# [27]. We chose to define broad initial clusters for further
# analysis to allow for missing cases and potential transmission
# between more genetically distant cases."

# Arguments to script:
# Study accession, threshold for SNP dist, distance matrix & ID (Plink output) files location,
# output directory for clusters file, output directory for plot file

# Input:
# Square distance matrix generated by Plink, two-col ID list also generated by Plink

# Main steps:
# Clean data - add IDs as row and col names to distance matrix > convert upper triangle to 0 >
# do clustering with hclust(x, method = 'single') > output plot of clustering (tree) >
# pull clusters of samples below/equal to threshold > write groups

# Output:
# png of tree with clusters below hline, list of samples within a cluster

# RUN:
# Assume run from ~/transmission:
# Rscript r_scripts/transmission_clusters.R <study_accession> <threshold> <dm and id dir> <output dir clusters> <output dir plot>
# Rscript r_scripts/transmission_clusters.R PRJEB7669 50 dist_and_pca/ metadata/ plots/
